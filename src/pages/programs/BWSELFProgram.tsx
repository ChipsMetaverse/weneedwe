                    The HIV department provides outreach, schools, and clinical organizations with HIV prevention education and science-based intervention programs such as SISTA (Sisters Informing Sisters about Topics on AIDS) and WILLOW (Women Involved in Life Learning from Other Women).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These interventions target Black women (25-44 years of age), young adult women who are at high risk for HIV, and the MSM gender loving men.

                    In 2010, Women's Family Planning, Inc. and NIDAAC (Black Women's Advocacy Initiative/Lifestyle Activists)â€”a working group of Black and African cisgender women collaborated to develop the "Our Power, Our Voice, Our Control" educational intervention designed as this Toolkit. This Toolkit is sponsored and supported by the Chicago Department of Public Health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Toolkit set out to ensure healthcare professionals who treat, care for, and/or support Black women with HIV/AIDS are aware of barriers that Black women face when seeking HIV prevention and accessing medical treatments and their negative experience of HIV stigma.

                    Women encounter social inequity throughout the United States. The rate of new HIV infections among Black women is 20 times higher than that of white women and 5 times as high as Hispanic women. The proportion of Black women with new HIV infections reveals a severe health disparity. These inequities highlight the importance of HIV prevention strategies for Black women.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This Toolkit contains a series of health & wellness webinars presented by Black women experts and physicians skilled to encourage trust between patients and providers and what can lead to health inequities. The Toolkit provided a forum for BW-SELF health ambassadors to be an agency of change for their peers' voice, and as a tool used to fix the wrongs in the healthcare industry. UFC hosted 5 focus groups where Black and African women voiced their concerns/barriers they faced when going to their doctor. Focus groups were held in person pre-COVID-19 and on the internet. YouTube Socials and our Showcase of Change was the survey included on this site.

                    UFC has collaborated with the Chicago Department of Public Health to provide free HIV rapid testing and support for Black cisgender heterosexual women seeking services, peer-to-peer relationships or just looking for literature for navigating HIV care. Our approach is tailored to help Black men for prevention messages.
