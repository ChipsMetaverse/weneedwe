WEBINARS - Black Women Supporting Empowering Lifestyle Factors
Our Risk Reduction Department and BW-SELF Health Ambassadors are reaching out to the community to reduce the number of new infections, and ultimately eradicate the HIV/AIDS epidemic through education, testing, and ongoing collaborations. We have recently enhanced our outreach tactics to a more community development approach, technically advanced via this Toolkit, and accessible method for both the department, all 77 Communities, medical professions, collaborators, and its supporters.

We now provide online webinars, viable information, and support through this website (weneedwe.org) and SheStories blog builders to keep in touch with all communities with just a click of a button. We our proud to say that we can now access the community at our fingertips and create a sense of awareness, through mass media systems, about HIV and how we can prevent the epidemic and #Getting2Zero infections.

A Condom For Everyone
According to a study released 6/24/08 by PLoS Medicine, watching a video in an STD clinic waiting room can reduce the risk for a new STD by almost 10%. In a large multi-center intervention trial, Dr. Lee Warner from the Centers for Disease control and Prevention and a team of researchers at different institutions in the U.S. studied the effect of a carefully crafted, 23-minute waiting room video on the risk for new STDs among 40,000 patients in 3 STD clinics in the country.
