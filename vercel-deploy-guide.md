# Simple Vercel Deployment Guide

## 1. Create a Vercel Account
- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up
- Connect your GitHub account

## 2. Create a Project in Vercel
- In the Vercel dashboard, click "Add New..." → "Project"  
- Select your GitHub repository (weneedwe)
- Keep the default settings (Vite framework should be automatically detected)
- Add environment variables if needed (like Supabase keys)
- Click "Deploy"

## 3. Set Up Your Domain (Optional)
- In your project in the Vercel dashboard, go to "Settings" → "Domains"
- Add your domain and follow the instructions

## Troubleshooting
- If you see build errors, check the deployment logs in Vercel
- Make sure all required environment variables are set in Vercel
- The terser issue was fixed by adding it to your package.json

## For Future Deployments
Vercel will automatically deploy when you push to the main branch. Just:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

Then check your Vercel dashboard to see the deployment progress.
