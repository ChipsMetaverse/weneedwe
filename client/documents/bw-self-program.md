# BW-SELF Advocacy Program

## BLACK WOMEN SELF EMPOWERING LIFESTYLE FACTORS

BW-SELF is a workgroup of Black and African women health ambassadors. As an agency of change on how women access healthcare, the BW-SELF addresses health disparities that Black women face that can lead to HIV negative cisgender heterosexual women to not achieve viral suppression and prevent HIV negative cisgender heterosexual women to remain negative.

## OUR POWER, OUR VOICE, OUR CONTROL!

This slogan represents the core philosophy behind the BW-SELF program, emphasizing empowerment, self-advocacy, and taking control of one's health journey.

## Program Background

The BW-SELF Advocacy program was developed in collaboration with the Chicago Department of Public Health's Community Development Program for Black Cisgender Heterosexual Women. This toolkit was specifically designed to address barriers for Black and African women accessing healthcare.

## Webinar Series

The program includes a toolkit with over 12 webinars titled "Our Power, Our Voice, Our Control." These webinars were presented by Black women doctors/providers and focus on topics related to discretion in medical practices and biases that create health disparities.

## Program Objectives

1. **Empowerment**: Providing Black women with the knowledge and tools to advocate for themselves in healthcare settings.

2. **Education**: Increasing awareness about specific health disparities affecting Black women.
