**BLACK WOMEN SELF EMPOWERING LIFESTYLE FACTORS**

BW-SELF is a workgroup of Black and African women health ambassadors. As an agency of change on how women access healthcare, the BW-SELF will address health disparities that Black women face that can lead to HIV negative cisgender heterosexual women to not achieve viral suppression and prevent HIV negative cisgender heterosexual women to remain negative.
